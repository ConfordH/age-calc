# Age Calculator

## Overview

The Age Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their age based on the input of their birthdate. It validates the input, ensuring that the provided date, month, and year are within valid ranges and rejects non-numerical input.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the Age Calculator interface.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file for styling the user interface.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for age calculation and input validation.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the date, month, and year of your birth in the respective input fields.
3. Click the "Get Age" button to calculate and display your age.
4. If the input is invalid or contains non-numerical characters, a popup will indicate the error.
